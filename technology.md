# Technologies Used

Which tools are the best fit for your project? 

We have chosen the following: 
- PostgreSQL to store large and sophisticated data safely
- PySpark to have a wide range of libraries and use it for Machine Learning Analysis. It provides simple and comprehensive API.
- CSV files to read data and then to import into a spreadsheet or another storage database
- Tableau to create a dashboard and story for presenting our analysis 
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to model the data stored in our database

etc....
