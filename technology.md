# NEOs_Project

# Technologies Used

Which tools are the best fit for your project? 

We have chosen the following: 
- PostgreSQL to store data
- Pandas for data cleaning and analysis
- Tableau to create a dashboard and story for presenting our analysis 
- 

What will be used for each section? For example, data cleaning and data storage will be completed using two different tools. 

How will the dashboard be built? All of these different components play a large part in project efficacy, so knowing them beforehand helps smooth the workflow.

By the live session, submit a list of technologies you and your team intend to use for the project. Make sure to explain which technology is being used where (e.g., Pandas for data cleaning, Postgres for storage, etc.).
