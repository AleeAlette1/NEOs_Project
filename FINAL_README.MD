## Final Project Assesment Deliverable

### Self-Assessment
My main focus throughout the duration of the project was devoliping a machine learning model to be used for prediction of hazardous asteroid in the future.
Even though my main focus was ML, me and my other team members were constantly discussing how each of our role is connected to their portion of the project. For example, the output of Database effort was the input of machine learning and I was sharing with
other database members how they can tailor the database in a manner that can be beneficial for the machine learning.
Even though I did not participate in managing github branches and merges, me and my other ML team member were having our inputs to github manager for final compilation of readme section for machine learning to make sure
readme is inclusive of both of our findings.
My greatest personal challenge for this project was understanding the meaning and functionality of all asteronomical features we had in our database. It was very crucial for my role to learn the meaning behind the features
to make the final determination of final feature variables. I was able to tackle this task by reading through multiple segments of Nasa's website and also I read multiple articles and papers.

### Team-Assesment
Our communication revolved around group discussion during weekly class meetings and sharing ideas in Slack group channel. We occasionaly had virtual zoom calls to share our challenges and brainstorm on best ways to approach project-related challenges.
One key accomplishment of our strong coomunication was effective project planning with least amount of time and having all team member's buy in on key decision-making processes throughout the project.
One lesson we learnt during our final project, and we will do differently in future projects is developing clear expectations from each person's role. Defining deliverables by a certain deadline for each team/member will help the whole team be onboard with all
the expectations.
Our group's biggest strength was team work and communication in an effective manner. For instance, in one of the final stages of machine learning, In order to come up with ideas to develop a notebook to make predictions on future data, I asked another team member who 
was working on database section of the project, to take on pre-processing of future data and making the connections to AWS in a jupyter notebook. His contribution help me spend more time and work on improving my understanding of feature variables and improved the performance of
ML Model. Going above and beyond our roles was a key factor for success of the project.
