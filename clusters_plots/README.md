# Plotting data

This folder contains several plots created to analyze and visualize the input data.  We started by creating what is in the plots folder, creating 2D plots that have the pha as the color, and each axis as one of the inputs.  There was an interesting result in the moid vs moid_ld plot, in that it appears to be perfectly linear.

The clusters folder contains 3D visualizations using different clusters, using all integers between 2 and 7.  An elbow curve was also created, in the elbow curve folder, showing the 2 clusters was optimal.  Seems like a good result since pha is either 0 or 1.  There is also a jupyter notebook file in the elbow_curve folder showing how the plots were created.
