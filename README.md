## Database
#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
For our database we decided to use PostgreSQL because __Â  The image below represents the tables of data that we uploaded onto the database. We used three main tables with the data to build and perform the machine learning model with the primary designation being the most common connect between all of our datasets:
