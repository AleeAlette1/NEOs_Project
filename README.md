# NEOs_Project

## Started by cleaning the data.

Dropped all NAN for the PHA (potentially hazardous asteroid) and converted Y/N to 1 or 0.
Created 3 different datasets to run through a random forest.  Noticed that set 1 had a lot of NAN in regards to size of asteroid, will not use that set in ML model.
